# The Quick and Painless To-Do App

In this project I have refactored the exisiting JavaScript in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Functionality

This project entails a simple "To-Do" app, that is user friendly and no-fuss. The goal for users are to name their "To-Do" task/chore, add a due date and submit. Then as the user completes a task/chore, they have the ability to check it off or delete it from the list they have created. This project also is coded to show a counter of the total tasks that need to be completed and the amount of tasks that have been checked completed. This counter updates as the user adds, deletes or completes the tasks that they added to the app.

## Technology

This project includes the use of JavaScript, HTML/CSS. Using an array of to-do items and actions with Javascript. By using Object-Oriented programming, coding have been categorized by classes such as the "Todo" file and the "FormValidator" file. These files contain code that are private to each method, making it optimal for interface accessibility and function.
